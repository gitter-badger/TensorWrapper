/** \brief The class responsible for implementing lazy addition.
 *
 *  Given an expression like: \f$A+B\f$ this class will store a copy of both
 *  \f$A\f$ and \f$B\f$.  Then when eval is called it will actually add \f$A\f$
 *  and \f$B\f$ together by calling the corresponding tensor backend.
 *
 *  Because of how C++ evalutes expressions it will be the case that \p LHS_t is
 *  always derived from OperationBase; however, \p RHS_t may not be.  Therefore
 *  we rely on convert's specializations and always wrap \p RHS_t in a convert
 *  call to guarantee the API we want.  Similarly, this is why we grab rank,
 *  indices, and scalar_type form the left type.
 *
 *  \tparam LHS_t The type of \f$A\f$.  Expected to derive from OperationBase
 *  \tparam RHS_t The type \f$B\f$.
